Operating system support
---
Cypherium is a derivative blockchain system compatible with Ethereum. With the integration of blockchains connected to various consensus chains, it will run mixed signature accounts such as ed22519 and ecdsa. This version only supports transaction signatures for ECDSA and consensus signatures for ED25519. To participate in consensus, it is necessary to create a new account through the client-side personan.newAccountEd25519 in order to participate and receive a coin reward. It will be used as a weighted coin to participate in the subsequent consensus and enter the committee. After supporting transactions with ed25519, it can participate in the transfer of this account.

Public iP for VPS is needed
--
Your ip of your machine or VPS which used to deploy cypher node  must be `public IP`.such AWS ec2 which has `public IP` to deploy your cypher node!
Open Consensus port `7100` (UDP), P2P block synchronous port `6000` and `30301` (TCP and UDP) , RPC port `8000` (TCP). The P2P port and RPC port can be any port that is not occupied by the system.
If no `POST, CURL, GET` or other RPC requests are sent to this node, the RPC port should be closed to prevent possible network attacks.

Install the openssl
--

for linux
 ```
sudo apt-get install openssl
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
 ```
for mac:
 ```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl
cd openssl
sudo ./config --prefix=/usr/local/openssl
make
make install
openssl version
 ```
Download repository
---
 #### 1. Install Git:
   for linux,run follow command:
    ```
   sudo apt-get install git  
    ```

   for mac,visit follow URL to install:
    ```
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/
    ```
 #### 2. Open the terminal and clone repository:
 ```
  git clone https://github.com/cypherium/cypher-bin.git
  cd cypher-bin
  ls
 ```
 #### 3.List the mainly use files
  `resetStart.sh`:can delete chaindb automic,and restart chaind directly,the txBlock and keyBlock will syn from 0.
  `start.sh`:continue the txBlock and keyBlock Height,and going on.<br>

   Below are all start mode commands:<br>
   ```./start.sh --silent```or ```./start.sh 0``` :start cypher application and output the log to the cypherlog.txt<br>
   ```./start.sh --detail```or ```./start.sh 1```:start cypher application and print the log online<br>
   ```./resetStart.sh --silent```or ```./start.sh 0```:reset start cypher application and output the log to the cypherlog.txt<br>
   ```./resetStart.sh --detail```or ```./start.sh 1```:reset start cypher application and print the log online<br>

 Two method to run the cypher
 ---

 #### run from genesis block 0 by script
 for console detail print mode you should run this:
 ```
  ./resetStart.sh --detail
 ```
 or  for silent mode ,you should run this
 ```
  ./resetStart.sh
 ```
 If you want to run testNet,please append  `test` to the command,such as `/resetStart.sh 1 test`
After doing this,now the log is output to the `cypherlog.txt` file or console immediately,you can check  the dynamic log.
Congratulations! You have successfully started the Cypherium Node!

 #### run from genesis block 0 step by step
   * init genesis block
   
     ```for linux
     ./linux/cypher --datadir ./linux/chaindb init ./genesis.json
     ```
     ```for mac
     ./mac/cypher --datadir ./mac/chaindb init ./genesis.json
     ```
   * start

     ```for linux
     ./linux/cypher --nat "none" --ws  txpool --rnetport 7100 -wsaddr="0.0.0.0" --wsorigins "*" --rpc --rpccorsdomain "*" --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpcapi eth,web3,personal,miner --port 6000 --rpcport 18004 --verbosity 4 --datadir ./linux/chaindb --networkid 16162 --gcmode archive --bootnodes "cnode://098c1149a1476cf44ad9d480baa67d956715b8671a4915bed17d06a1cafd7b154bc1841d451d80d391427ebc48aaa3216d4e8a2b46544dffdc61b76be6475418@13.72.80.40:9090"  console 2>"cypherlog.txt"
     ```

       ```
       
  #### start up parameters help
    
   The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `cypher`,
    whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
    subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
    you'd expect.
    
   HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:
    
   * `--addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
   * `--rpcport` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8000`)
   * `--port` P2P listening port (default: `6000`)
   * `--api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
   * `--corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
   * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
   * `--wsaddr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
   * `--wsport` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8000`)
   * `--wsorigins` Origins from which to accept websockets requests
   * `--rpcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,shh,txpool,web3`)
   * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)
   * `--nat value`  NAT port mapping mechanism (any|none|upnp|pmp|extip:<IP>) (default: "any")
   * `--rnetport` Committee consensus port(default: `7100`)
   * `--verbosity` Output log level,max value is 6(default: `4`)
   * `--datadir` Data directory for the databases and keystore
   * `--networkid` Network identifier (16162=mainNet)
   * `--datadir` Blockchain garbage collection mode ("full", "archive") (default: "full")
   * `--bootnodes`  The first time a node connects to the network it uses one of the predefined bootnodes. Through these bootnodes a node can join the network and find other nodes.
   * `--mine`  Enable mining	
   * `--console` Start an interactive JavaScript environment
    
   You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
   connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `cypher` node configured with the above flags. You
   can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!
    
   **Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an S based
   transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
   Cypherium nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
   running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
   API
    
Troubleshooting
---
   #### If you get `panic: not exists jdk class!` crash
   * Execute `sudo passwd` to create root password if you have not created.
   * Please give the `jdk` folder read/write permission by typing `sudo chmod -R 777 ./jdk`.
   #### If you cannot execute the bin, try the following tips:
   *  Make sure you are operating on the root account of your computer. (You can do this with the command “sudo” and entering your password.
   If you have not created a root password yet, `sudo passwd` will help you set a password to your root account.)
   * Execute command `sudo chmod -R 777 .` when your current directory path is at `../cypherBFTBin/`
   * Execute `sudo rm -rf chaindb` to delete the database. Then, regenerate the database by executing `./cypher -–datadir chaindb  init ../genesis.json`
   * Execute shell `./resetStart.sh` can delete database automic,and restart directly.As soon as you finding the chainId is different from previous chaindId which is checked through executing
   *  Make sure you are operating on the root account of your computer. (You can do this with the command “su” and entering your password.
   If you have not created a root password yet, `sudo passwd` will help you set a password to your root account.)
   * Execute command `sudo chmod -R 777 .` when your current directory path is at `../cypherBFTBin/`
   * Execute `sudo rm -rf chaindb` to delete the database. Then, regenerate the database by executing `./cypher -–datadir chaindb  init ../genesis.json`
   * Execute shell `./resetStart.sh` can delete database automic,and restart directly.As soon as you finding the chainId is different from previous chaindId which is checked through executing
   #### If you get a libcrypto.so.1.0.0 or openssl 1.0.0 error and you're using unbuntu 
   * Execute command `wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl1.0/libssl1.0.0_1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.13_amd64.deb` to download the proper libraries to resolve the issue
   * Execute command `sudo dpkg -i libssl1.0.0_1.0.2n-1ubuntu5.13_amd64.deb` to install the package
   * Execute shell `./resetStart.sh` and it will now load properly
